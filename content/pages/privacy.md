## Cookies

I use Google Analytics to record information about the pages a user has seen, for example the URL of the page, time of day, device used, etc. The information that I collect is anonymized and sent to Google Analytics for analysis.

Google Analytics mainly uses first-party cookies to report on visitor interactions on this website. Users may disable cookies or delete any individual cookie. [Learn more](https://policies.google.com/technologies/cookies)

In addition, Google Analytics supports an optional browser [add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/) that – once installed and enabled – disables measurement by Google Analytics for any site a user visits. Note that this add-on only disables Google Analytics measurement.

Google Analytics also collects Internet Protocol (IP) addresses to provide and protect the security of the service, and to give website owners a sense of which country, state, or city in the world their users come from (also known as &ldquo;IP geolocation&rdquo;).
