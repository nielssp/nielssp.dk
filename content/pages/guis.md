# GUIs
Inspired by [GUIdebook](https://guidebookgallery.org) and the [toastytech GUI gallery](http://toastytech.com/guis/index.html) I've decided to start a small collection of screenshots of older desktop environments and applications that I find interesting in some way. In particular, I'm a big fan of the look of early Linux desktop environments and window managers as well as late-'90s desktop GUIs in general.

So far I've played around with the following versions of Slackware Linux in VirtualBox:

* Slackware 7.1
	* [KDE 1.1.2](guis/kde-1.1.2/screenshots.md)
	* [GNOME 1.2](guis/gnome-1.2/screenshots.md)
* Slackware 8.0
	* [KDE 2.1.2](guis/kde-2.1.2/screenshots.md)
	* [GNOME 1.4](guis/gnome-1.4/screenshots.md)
* Slackware 8.1
	* KDE 3.0.1
	* GNOME 1.4
	* XFCE 3.8
* Slackware 9.1
	* KDE 3.1
	* GNOME 2.4
	* XFCE 3.99.4
