Underground Tomorrow was a persistent browser based game created for [PBBG Jam 2022](https://itch.io/jam/persistent-browser-based-game-jam-2022). The game was text-based and inspired by the Fallout games.

The frontend was implemented in TypeScript using [CSTK](https://github.com/nielssp/cstk) and the backend was implemented in Rust using Actix.
