# apakoh.dk
My first domain name, registered in May of 2011. Originally only contained a single link to [Plan T from Outer Space](/things/ptfos), but I was working on several other games as well (mostly browser-based). Turned into a blog (using [PeanutCMS](/things/peanutcms)) in 2013, but I never wrote anything other than a short introduction. Removed the blog when I created [nielssp.dk](/things/nielssp-dk) in 2015. Now just a list of links.

I also have an offline version of the Apakoh-website, containing a list of all the browser-based games I have been working on at some point. Most of them were never finished.
