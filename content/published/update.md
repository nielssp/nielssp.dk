# Update
Today, I replaced the home-cooked CMS ([Jivoo](https://github.com/jivoo) CMS), which this blog was running on, with a home-cooked static site generator (with a web-based GUI similar to a CMS) that I'm working on. I also changed the design a bit&hellip; Considering it's been around 15 months since my last post, I guess I just find it easier to work on the technical parts of a blog rather than the actual content. I do however have a number of shorter posts planned for the near-future.
