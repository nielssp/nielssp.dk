# Website redesign 

Today I made some changes to the design of my website. The primary change is the removal of pagination in favor of showing the complete list of blog posts (titles and publication dates only) on the front page. Considering the slow rate at which I've been publishing posts, I didn't think it really made sense to only show the 5 most recent posts (thus hiding older but still relevant posts).

Additionally, the menu and header are now shown on the left on larger screens, and links are underlined as they should be.
