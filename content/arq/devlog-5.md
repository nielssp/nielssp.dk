# #5: Trees!

A world consisting of only grass and dirt would be a bit boring, so I drew some trees.
Unlike with the surface tiles, I don't think there's any real shortcuts to doing this. I did spend a lot of time looking at pictures of trees for reference though.

I also experimented with making &ldquo;supertiles&rdquo; of dense forest that can be used to wall off different parts of the map:
