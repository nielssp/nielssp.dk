# #11: Various graphical updates

I went back and redesigned some of the tile transitions I presented in [devlog #4](devlog-4.md):

<figcaption>Diagonal paths.</figcaption>
</figure>

First of all, paths can now be diagonal, in fact there are now 16 different angles. I also added a direct transition from grass to water and tried to add some depth to it. I did the same thing with the transition between grass and sand. It should make the map look a bit more 3-dimensional:

</figure>


I also tried my hand at drawing some more buildings. I recently made this one inspired by medieval Scandinavian architecture:

</figure>

I'm still experimenting with color palettes.
