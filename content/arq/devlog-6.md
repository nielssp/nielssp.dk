# #6: Buildings

I made some tiles for making buildings (using the same technique as in [devlog #4](devlog-4.md) to create some of the textures):

<figure>
<img src="../images/arq/buildings.png" alt="Buildings"/>
<figcaption>Various buildings.</figcaption>
</figure>

I made a number of different variations for roofing and walls and I'll probably make more once I start actually building the world.
